                img.about-image(src="images/about.jpg" alt="Jonny Scarramuzza sitting at his work bench")
                p Jonny Scarramuzza is a father of two working from his family home nestled in the Tanat Valley in Mid Wales. His love of art began as a child and he spent much of his time drawing and painting. He went on to study art for both GCSE & A level before studying for a Bachelor of Arts at Southampton University.
                p Jonny is influenced by his rural environment and works mostly with local slate and stone - all one off unique pieces with their own personal history of textures and markings. Jonny etches and carves his designs into the slate or stone by hand adding another layer of beauty to what is already there. He makes rustic stands for his work out of wood and aged metal he finds on his local walks.
                p As part of Jonny Scarramuzza’s art collection many of his designs have been adapted to print. Hand carved into lino blocks and individually hand printed with ink. These prints are available to buy, many of which have been made into greeting cards that can be purchased as sets.
                p Jonny uses his art work as a form of meditation. The calming effect it brings him seems to go with the work to its new home. Much of the feedback he has received is of the peaceful quality his work brings into the home.
